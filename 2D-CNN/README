2D Convolutional Neural Network 

Apply model to all pixels
Generate full list of every pixels 
Subset images for every pixels - every single pixels in the images need to take the pixel overlapping patches (11 by 11)
While 2D is for the time sieries of given pixel, 3D is for the times series of given pixels for all surrounding pixels

1- Target: Four labels (Sky, Window, Building, Air conditioner)
- Target is the source of the pixels
- Target is set for the automatic classification

2- Feature:  the time series of the pixels I picked (Sky: 30 pixels, Window: 30 pixels, Building: 100 pixels, Air conditioiner: 30 pixels, Total: 190 pixels 
             for 11 by 11 box and 100 images, feat.shape is 152, 11,11,100 
- The featuers are information around the object to classify that one pixel
- In this research, the features are the brightness at each time series.

3 -Object:
(For picked pixels) Pixels that are picked for the prediction (For 0.2 test set, 190 pixels * 0.8 = 152 pixels) 
(For all pixels) Object is all the pixels - every one single pixels that time series is associated with it.
- The object is just one single pixel which is centered
- In this research, the object is automatic detection of brightness
