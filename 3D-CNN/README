3D Convolutional Neural Network 

1- Target: Four labels (Sky, Window, Building, Ari conditioner)

2- Feature: pixels I picked for labels (Sky: 30 pixels, Window: 30 pixels, Building: 100 pixels, Air conditioiner: 30 pixels, Total: 190 pixels)

3 -Object: 

(For picked pixels) Pixels that are picked for the prediction (For 0.2 test set, 190 pixels * 0.8 = 152 pixels) 

(For all pixels) Every one single pixels that time series is associated with it
