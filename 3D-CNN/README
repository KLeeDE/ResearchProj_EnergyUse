3D Convolutional Neural Network 

1- Target: Four labels (Sky, Window, Building, Ari conditioner)

2- Feature: pixels I picked for labels (Sky: 30 pixels, Window: 30 pixels, Building: 100 pixels, Air conditioiner: 30 pixels, Total: 190 pixels)

3 -Object: Every one single pixels that time series is associated with it
