3D Convolutional Neural Network 

Apply model to all pixels
Generate full list of every pixels 
Subset images for every pixels - every single pixels in the images need to take the pixel overlapping patches (11 by 11)
While 2D is for the time sieries of given pixel, 3D is for the times series of given pixels for all surrounding pixels

1- Target: Four labels (Sky, Window, Building, Ari conditioner)

2- Feature: pixels I picked for labels (Sky: 30 pixels, Window: 30 pixels, Building: 100 pixels, Air conditioiner: 30 pixels, Total: 190 pixels)
In 3D CNN, features are not just the time series of that pixel, but it is time series of its neighbors too (For 11 by 11 cube and 100 images, feat.shape is 152, 11,11,100). 
The featuers are information around the object to classify that one pixel.

3 -Object: 
But the object is just one single pixel which is centered
(For picked pixels) Pixels that are picked for the prediction (For 0.2 test set, 190 pixels * 0.8 = 152 pixels) 
(For all pixels) Object is all the pixels - every one single pixels that time series is associated with it.
