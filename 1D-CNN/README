1D Convolutional Neural Network 


1- Target: Four labels (Sky, Window, Building, Air conditioner)
- Target is the source of the pixels
- Target is set for the automatic classification

2- Feature:  the single pixels I picked (Sky: 30 pixels, Window: 30 pixels, Building: 100 pixels, Air conditioiner: 30 pixels, Total: 190 pixels) 
- The featuers are information around the object to classify that one pixel
- In this research, the features are the brightness

3 -Object:
(For picked pixels) Pixels that are picked for the prediction 
(For all pixels) Object is all the pixels 
- The object is just one single pixel which is centered
